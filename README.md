# Consumer-Centric API Design

This book covers a wide range of information regarding the design of HTTP-based APIs. The intent is to
build easy-to-use APIs which your consumers will love. Everything from URL design and consistent usage
of HTTP methods to more esoteric topics such as authentication paradigms and permissions are covered.

My goal is to eventually get this published (either self-published or through a publisher) and sell copies.
One might think making content freely available while also planning on selling it would be disasterous,
but hey, if it works for Trent Reznor perhaps it can work for me.

The book is currently around 55 pages long. If there is any content you feel the book is missing, please
submit a question in the form of an issue and I'll go ahead and write about it!

## Buy a Physical Copy

A physical copy of this book is now available for purchase via Amazon! If you would like to support
this project please consider purchasing a copy:

## Downloading PDFs

[Download Book Builds Here](https://github.com/tlhunter/consumer-centric-api-design/tree/master/pdf)

The PDFs make heavy usage of hyperlinking within the document. The Table of Contents, for example, link
to relevant sections. References to figures will link to the figure. References will link to more
information in the back of the book.

Pages will have alternating margins, as this is intended to be printed front and back. All diagrams are
rendered in vector to keep filesize small and quality high.

## Contributing

If you'd like to see more topics covered in this book, submit an issue with your question and I'll either
research and write up some content, ask for clarification, or possibly close the issue if it feels too
outside the scope of the book.

If you'd like to write content for the book, submit a pull request and I'll check it out (contact me
beforehand just to make sure the topic you write about is something that'll fit into the scope of the
book). When this happens, I'll come up with some sort of system for keeping track of contributors, and
probably have a dedicated page in the book itself. Content submitted in this manner will be given the
once over by yours-truly to ensure consistency in writing style.

Of course, any contributions made to this book will give me (and whatever publisher I go with)
non-exclusive rights to do whatever we want with it. Sorry, legal stuff.

## Installing LaTeX

Installing LaTeX will allow you to build the book yourself if you plan on contributing. However, it is
not necessary that you have LaTeX installed nor that your content properly adheres to the spec. If you
don't want to go through the effort to learn it, simply toss some content where you think it should go,
submit a pull request, and I'll look it over and make the necessary modifications.

### OS X

There's a convenient package you can install called [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/). Once you install
MacTeX, you'll want to add it's directory to your PATH, e.g. append the following to `.bash_profile`:

```bash
PATH="$PATH:/usr/texbin"
export PATH
```

There's also a homebrew cask you can tap, but in the background it grabs that same package.

### Debian/Ubuntu Linux

If you're using a Debian-based linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu), install the package `texlive`:

```
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-font-utils
```

Other distributions may have different package names.

### Windows

On windows, you can install the [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) project (although you won't be able to run
`build.sh` to compiile the book, you'll need to run the relevant commands manually).

## Building the Book

Once you have LaTeX run the following command from within the book directory:

```
./build.sh
```

The book will be named something like `Consumer-Centric API Design vX.Y.Z.pdf`.
